In September 2018 I published a book named [Build a SaaS app in Go](https://buildsaasappingo.com/). This project is the transformation of what the book teaches into a library that can be used to quickly build a web app / SaaS and focusing on your core product instead of common SaaS components.

*This is under development and API will change.*

*Migrating to PostgreSQL at the moment.*

### Usage quick example

You can create your main package and copy the `docker-compose.yml`. You'll need Redis and PostgreSQL for the library to work.

```go
package main

import (
	"net/http"
	"github.com/jlb922/gosaas"
	"github.com/jlb922/gosaas/model"
)

func main() {
	routes := make(map[string]*gosaas.Route)
	routes["test"] = &gosaas.Route{
		Logger:      true,
		MinimumRole: model.RolePublic,
		Handler: http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
			gosaas.Respond(w, r, http.StatusOK, "hello world!")
		}),
	}

	mux := gosaas.NewServer(routes)
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", mux)
}
```

Than start the docker containers and your app:

```shell
$> docker-compose up
$> go run main.go
```

Than you request localhost:8080:

```shell
$> curl http://localhost:8080/test
"hello? world!"
```

## Installation

`go get github.com/jlb922/gosaas`

## What's included

The following aspects are covered by this library:

* Web server capable of serving HTML templates, static files. Also JSON for an API.
* Easy helper functions for parsing and encoding type<->JSON.
* Routing logic in your own code.
* Middlewares: logging, authentication, rate limiting and throttling.
* User authentication and authorization using multiple ways to pass a token and a simple role based authorization.
* Database agnostic data layer. Currently handling PostgreSQL.
* User management, billing (per account or per user) and webhooks management. [in dev]
* Simple queue (using Redis) and Pub/Sub for queuing tasks.
* Cron-like scheduling for recurring tasks.

The in dev part means that those parts needs some refactoring compare to what was built 
in the book. The vast majority of the code is there and working, but it's not "library" friendly 
at the moment.

## Quickstart

Here's some quick tips to get you up and running.

### Defining routes

You only need to pass the top-level routes that gosaas needs to handle via a `map[string]*gosaas.Route`.

For example, if you have the following routes in your web application:

`/task, /task/mine, /task/done, /ping`

You would pass the following `map` to gosaas's `NewServer` function:

```go
routes := make(map[string]*gosaas.Route)
routes["task"] = &gosaas.Route{
	Logger: true,
	WithDB: true,
	handler: task,
	...
}
routes["ping"] = &gosaas.Route(
	Logger: true,
	Handler: ping,
)
```

Where `task` and `ping` are types that implement `http`'s `ServeHTTP` function, for instance:

```go
type Task struct{}

func (t *Task) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	// you handle the rest of the routing logic in your own code
	var head string
	head, r.URL.Path = gosaas.ShiftPath(r.URL.Path)
	if head =="/" {
		t.list(w, r)
	} else if head == "mine" {
		t.mine(w, r)
	}
	...
}
```

You may define `Task` in its own package or inside your `main` package.

Each route can opt-in to include specific middleware, here's the list:

```go
// Route represents a web handler with optional middlewares.
type Route struct {
	// middleware
	WithDB           bool // Adds the database connection to the request Context
	Logger           bool // Writes to the stdout request information
	EnforceRateLimit bool // Enforce the default rate and throttling limits

	// authorization
	MinimumRole model.Roles // Indicates the minimum role to access this route

	Handler http.Handler // The handler that will be executed
}
```

This is how you would handle parameterized route `/task/detail/id-goes-here`:

```go
func (t *Task) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	var head string
	head, r.URL.Path = gosaas.ShiftPath(r.URL.Path)
	if head == "detail" {
		t.detail(w, r)
	}
}

func (t *Task) detail(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	id, _ := gosaas.ShiftPath(r.URL.Path)
	// id = "id-goes-here
	// and now you may call the database and passing this id (probably with the AccountID and UserID)
	// from the Auth value of the request Context
}
```

### Database

Before 2019/03/17 there's were a MongoDB implementation which has been removed 
to only support database/sql. PostgreSQL is currently the only supported driver.

The `data` package exposes a `DB` type that have a `Connection` field pointing 
to the database.

Before calling `http.ListenAndServe` you have to initialize the `DB` field of the `Server` type:

```go
db := &data.DB{}

if err := db.Open(*dn, *ds); err != nil {
	log.Fatal("unable to connect to the database:", err)
}

mux.DB = db
```

Where `*dn` and `*ds` are flags containing "postgres" and 
"user=postgres password=postgres dbname=postgres sslmode=disable" for example,
respectively which are the driver name and the datasource connection string.

This is an example of what your `main` function could be:

```go
func main() {
	dn := flag.String("driver", "postgres", "name of the database driver to use, only postgres is supported at the moment")
	ds := flag.String("datasource", "", "database connection string")
	q := flag.Bool("queue", false, "set as queue pub/sub subscriber and task executor")
	e := flag.String("env", "dev", "set the current environment [dev|staging|prod]")
	flag.Parse()

	if len(*dn) == 0 || len(*ds) == 0 {
		flag.Usage()
		return
	}

	routes := make(map[string]*gosaas.Route)
	routes["test"] = &gosaas.Route{
		Logger:      true,
		MinimumRole: model.RolePublic,
		Handler: http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
			gosaas.Respond(w, r, http.StatusOK, "hello? Worker!")
		}),
	}

	mux := gosaas.NewServer(routes)

	// open the database connection
	db := &data.DB{}

	if err := db.Open(*dn, *ds); err != nil {
		log.Fatal("unable to connect to the database:", err)
	}

	mux.DB = db

	isDev := false
	if *e == "dev" {
		isDev = true
	}

	// Set as pub/sub subscriber for the queue executor if q is true
	executors := make(map[queue.TaskID]queue.TaskExecutor)
	// if you have custom task executor you may fill this map with your own implementation 
	// of queue.taskExecutor interface
	cache.New(*q, isDev, executors)

	if err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", mux); err != nil {
		log.Println(err)
	}

}
```

### Responding to requests

The `gosaas` package exposes two useful functions:

**Respond**: used to return JSON:

```go
gosaas.Respond(w, r, http.StatusOK, oneTask)
```

**ServePage**: used to return HTML from templates:

```go
gosaas.ServePage(w, r, "template.html", data)
```

### JSON parsing

There a helper function called `gosaas.ParseBody` that handles the JSON decoding into types. This is a typical http handler:

```go
func (t Type) do(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	var oneTask MyTask
	if err := gosaas.ParseBody(r.Body, &oneTask); err != nil {
		gosaas.Respond(w, r, http.StatusBadRequest, err)
		return
	}
	...
}
```

### Context

You'll most certainly need to get a reference back to the database and the currently 
logged in user. This is done via the request `Context`.

```go
func (t Type) list(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	ctx := r.Context()
	db := ctx.Value(gosaas.ContextDatabase).(*data.DB)
	auth := ctx.Value(ContextAuth).(Auth)

	// you may use the db.Connection in your own data implementation
	tasks := Tasks{DB: db.Connection}
	list, err := tasks.List(auth.AccountID, auth.UserID)
	if err != nil {
		gosaas.Respond(w, r, http.StatusInternalServerError, err)
		return
	}
	Respond(w, r, http.StatusOK, list)
}
```

## Status and contributing

I'm currently trying to reach a v1 and planning to use this in production with my next SaaS.

If you'd like to contribute I'd be more than happy to discuss, post an issue and feel free to 
explain what you'd like to add/change/remove.

Here's some aspect that are still a bit rough:

* Not enough tests.
* Redis is **required** and cannot be changed easily, it's also coupled with the `queue` package.
* The controller for managing account/user is not done yet.
* The billing controller will need to be glued.
* The controllers package should be inside an `internal` package.
* Still not sure if the way the data package is written that it is idiomatic / easy to understand.
* There's no way to have granularity in the authorization, i.e. if /task require `model.RoleUser` /task/delete 
cannot have `model.RoleAdmin` as `MinimumRole`.

## Running the tests

At this moment the tests uses the `mem` data implementation so you need to run the tests 
using the `mem` tag as follow:

```shell
$> go test -tags mem ./...
```
