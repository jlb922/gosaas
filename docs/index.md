# User documentation for **gosaas** library

> This is a work in progress :). Please check the 
> [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/jlb922/gosaas).

### What and why?

In September 2018 I published a book called "[Build a SaaS app in Go](https://buildsaasappingo.com)" after building 
two SaaS with Go and a React front-end. I thought that it might be helpful to extract common pieces into a reusable 
Go library.

If you want to have all the details and support the project, you can buy the book which still contains up-to-date 
information about building a SaaS in Go.
